## Description

College expenses are rising, and your friend Jack Ma has come up with a money-making scheme. He photocopies obscure textbooks, as no PDF versions are available, and rents them out at a cheaper rate than Amazon. However, managing the growing number of textbooks has become a challenge. He needs an electronic management system to keep track of the photocopied textbooks in his warehouse.

This project, RipOffRental, is a Java application that simulates a warehouse with three shelves (A, B, and C). Each shelf can hold up to 20 photocopied textbooks, each represented by a title, author, borrower name, and condition score (1-5).

## Features

The RipOffRental management system offers the following features:

1. Add a new book to the collection.
2. Loan books out to borrowers.
3. Duplicate a textbook by photocopying it (using the clone() method).
4. Organize a shelf of most popular titles.
5. Swap textbook orders on the shelves for aesthetic and organizational balance.
6. Check if two shelves are identical in content (using the equals() method).
7. Remove sufficiently mutilated books from the system.

## Prerequisites

To run this Java application, ensure you have the following installed on your computer:

- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- Git (optional, for cloning the repository)

## Installation

1. Clone the RipOffRental repository to your local machine (if you haven't already).

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/yourusername/RipOffRental.git
$ cd RipOffRental

```
## Usage
 
 To compile and run the code locally

```bash
$ javac RipOffRental.java 
$ java RipOffRental
```
Follow the prompts in the command-line interface to interact with the warehouse management system. The system will guide you through adding new books, loaning books, duplicating textbooks, organizing shelves, and more.

Please note that the interface will match the specifications and guidelines provided in the project description.
